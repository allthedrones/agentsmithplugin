I appreciate very much help of
  * *Vladimir Smolyaninov*, who ported Agent Smith for ReSharper 4.0 and performed optimizations of spell checking engine.
  * *ERT Team*, especially Valentin Shtronda and Alex Dryga, who were the first users of the plugin and had very good suggestions (well, the name Agent Smith in particular I owe to them :)). 
  * All people who helped in any other way.
